# Rust Programming Language

An introduction to systems programming with Rust

# What is Rust?

- Modern systems programming language
- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Blazingly fast performance
- Prevents data races at compile time

# Key Features

- Ownership system for memory management
- Pattern matching for elegant code
- Strong static type system
- Zero-cost abstractions
- Excellent error handling with Result and Option

# Ownership System

- Each value has one owner
- Ownership can be moved or borrowed
- Borrowed references are checked at compile time
- Eliminates entire classes of bugs

# Why Choose Rust?

- Performance comparable to C and C++
- Memory safety without runtime overhead
- Great tooling with Cargo
- Growing ecosystem of libraries
- Supportive and welcoming community

# Getting Started

- Create a new project: cargo new my_project
- Write code in src/main.rs
- Run with: cargo run
- Build for release: cargo build --release

# Common Use Cases

- Systems programming
- WebAssembly development
- CLI tools
- Embedded systems
